# [Guess That Task](https://guess-that-task.vercel.app/)
A social deduction game where teams are split between imposters and crewmates. Crewmates are assigned tasks that they must perform without the imposters figuring them out. Imposters have limited time and guesses to figure out the crewmates' tasks.

This game is meant to be played in person, thought it is possible to be played online.

This game is based off [TWICE Play Among Us IRL And Rain Cooks Steak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjHLPihQq2w). Check it out!
